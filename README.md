# EmoSense: AI-Powered Emotion Detection System

**EmoSense** is an advanced AI tool designed to detect and analyze human emotions using facial recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and sentiment analysis. This project focuses on understanding human expressions through machine learning models to deliver accurate emotional insights.

## Features

- **Facial Expression Analysis**: Detects emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and more using computer vision techniques.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes text data to detect underlying emotions from written words.
- **Real-Time Emotion Detection**: Processes live camera feeds to provide real-time emotional feedback.
- **Customizable**: Supports various AI models and can be trained on custom datasets for more personalized emotion detection.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Tools**:
  - `OpenCV (cv2)` for real-time face detection and image processing.
  - `TensorFlow/Keras` for building and training neural networks.
  - `Google generative AI (google.generativeai)` for enhancing emotion detection capabilities.
  - `pyttsx3` for text-to-speech interaction.

## How It Works

1. **Face Detection**: Captures facial landmarks and analyzes expressions.
2. **Model Prediction**: The trained deep learning model predicts the emotional state based on facial inputs.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: If enabled, it takes text input and analyzes sentiment using NLP models.
4. **Feedback**: Displays or speaks the detected emotion through a user interface or voice output.
